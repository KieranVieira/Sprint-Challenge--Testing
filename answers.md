1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe is to define a group of tests such as if you were to test an end point you would make a describe for the route your testing, and then an it would be an individual test such as "Does this test return the right status code?"

Test driven development is interesting because you write your tests before writing the code so you expect you know what the code is going to do before you do it.

1. Mention three types of automated tests.

Automated tests could be multiple things:
 - checking for dom elements
 - testing for status codes
 - testing for return values
